# inline tips
###### _HTML is organized into blocks, but formatting can also be done inline_ 

Examples of inline-level elements include:
- The strong or b tag
- The span tag 
- Image tag
    - These have the attributes of alt (text if image is not displayed) and src (NB: The src tag can be external or a local image )
    
### Anchor Tags! (a)
- Are really important
- _"Butter of the internet"_
- Used with href (hypertext reference) which is the location the user is directed to e.g. file, url, etc.
    - href can also link to content on the same page which makes it easier to orientate
